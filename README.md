# Super Sonic Meow

A side-scrolling, web-based game developed by Ice Code--an apprentice team of web developers for AlphaWorks Tech--where Sonic the cat is on a mission to eat all the pies while avoiding the dangers that lie in the path ahead.

## Motivation

A project challenging us to expand our roles in tech as engineers, project managers, UI/UX desiginers and researchers, and digital marketers.

## Requirements to Run

- Desktop or laptop
- Chrome or Chromium Browser

## How to Play (Player Controls)

`RIGHT ARROW` - Forward    
`LEFT ARROW` - Backward     
`UP ARROW` or `SPACE` - Jump     
`ESC` - Pause

## Game Objective

Get Sonic to the finish line while trying to eat all of the pies before the time runs out!

## The Team behind the Project

Each member took on a specific role in the project for those interested to gain experience in tech adjacent roles as well. Due to time constraints and a team of multi-skilled individuals, some members assumed more than one role.
